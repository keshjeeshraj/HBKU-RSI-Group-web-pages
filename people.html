                    Sarah's thesis is entitled 'Modelling and optimization of EWF nexus systems for sustainable resource management- a food security case'. In light of the growing global population, pressures on resources are increasing dramatically leading to several environmental, economic, and social implications. Therefore, sustainable, and resilient systems that can coordinate between sectors should be designed in order to ensure efficient resource management. Those frameworks should be able to integrate multi-objective and multi-actor interlinkages existing between energy, water and food systems across multiple scale while accommodating for uncertainties, to guarantee a holistic analysis of the issue. Sustainable decision- making through adopting a EWF nexus thinking represents an interesting strategy to address modern resource management problems.

                    Ahmed’s thesis studies the performance of the biomass gasification process in the production of syngasvand subsequent optimization of the process, considering multiple parameters such as the thermodynamic operating conditions and type of gasifier will be of paramount importance. The fundamental component of this project is to undertake the necessary research required in order to enable the recycling of biomass. This involves critical knowledge enhancement, and development of the necessary process technology which will generate high energy syngas from the available biomass options when used in combination or individually. In this study, a computer simulation model of the biomass gasifier is developed using Aspen Plus considering Qatar’s biomass characteristics. This study differs from other literature studies in terms of its optimization nature by including various biomass feedstocks that includes date pits. The process can be optimized to maximize the product purity or yield, profit, operating efficiency, quality of raw materials blends, and to minimize the carbon footprint and production time. The study can be analysed using the concepts of Energy, Water and Food (EWF) Nexus and Game Theory and through Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) tools. Initial results demonstrate the possibility to utilize domestic feedstock in Qatar such as date palm residues amongst others to generate syngas.

                    Samar's research, entitled 'From biomass (food waste and biosolids) into high value-added biochars through pyrolysis', focuses on Biochar as a co-product of the thermochemical conversion (e.g. pyrolysis) of biomass, can be implemented into soils as an enhancer that improves the fertility and quality of agricultural soils while enhancing the sustainability of biomass and crop production. It can, hence, aid in combatting the issue of desertification, and improve global food security through several mechanisms, but mostly through increases in agricultural productivity. This is achieved by improving the water and nutrient holding capacities and consequently improving crop yields.

                    Qatar, among other countries, is experiencing a fast-growing economy which is associated with a number of challenges including waste handling and management. The aim of the current research is to use the pyrolysis process to produce biochars (carbon rich materials) from Qatari biomass waste, which can be used as soil enhancer or further processed into higher value-added products (e.g. adsorbents). Thus, it addresses the problem of environmental sustainability by alleviating problems arising from the above-mentioned waste. In addition, the application of biochars to Qatari soils holds great potential in terms of water savings needed for irrigation.

                    Sara's research, entitled 'Resilience of energy supply chain', focuses on determining how technology evolution may impact LNG supply chain and how the evolution of different technology options adapted by countries may impact the security of the supply chain. Resilience of energy supply chain is about handling the consequences of a disruption, not about preventing a disruption from occurring. However, the effort to create a resilient system is made before a disruption occurs. A good understanding of system failure modes can be relevant for this. Supply chain resilience this interest represents a shift in businesses away from traditional risk management thinking, which is insufficient in addressing the increased vulnerabilities, uncertainties and unforeseen disruptions faced by complex global supply chains.

                    Moreover, current energy security system which was created in 1973 response to the Arab oil embargo to ensure coordination among the industrialized countries in the event of a disruption in supply, encourage collaboration on energy policies, avoid bruising scrambles for supplies, and prevent any future use of an "oil weapon" by exporters. Today, the concept of energy security needs to be expanded to include the protection of the entire energy supply chain and infrastructure. As well as we are looking for the high picture of the stochastic optimization tools that can be combined with risk assessment tools to further enrich understanding of vulnerability in maritime transportation systems.
